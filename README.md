# Python-mini-projects
these all are the mini projects.

1.github_webscraping

In this project I write some code to get profile image of user.
user name is a command line input.

2. Bulk_file_renamer

To use this you need to enter your path in the path variable with double back slash instead of one.
[Note]: This will not work if you enter wrong path or not used double back slash. you can use front slash also.
All the explanation of the code is withcode itself in the file.

3. Countdown_timer 

This the Countdown timer made with time module with other few main functions as divmod, :02d function from format and "\r" to print in time in one line.
All the explanation of the code is withcode itself in the file.
